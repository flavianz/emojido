# Variables 📦
<br/>
Variables in EmojiDo are mutable by default and at the time, there is no way to make variables immutable. The type of a variable cannot be changed and is automatically inferred from the type of the initial value of the variable.
<br/>
You can define variables using the ```📦``` emoji, followed by the identifier and a ```🪢``` representing equals and the variables initial value like this:
<br/>
```
📦age🪢17🚀
```
<br/>
You can change a variable's value by providing the variable's identifier, followed by a ```🪢``` and the new value:
<br/>
```
age🪢33🚀
```
<br/>
Variables of type ```🧮``` or ```🔢``` can also be directly modified with mathematical operators like in these examples:
<br/>
```
age➕🪢5🚀
age➖🪢5🚀
age✖️🪢5🚀
age➗🪢5🚀
```
<br/>
To access a variable, simply provide its identifier like so:
<br/>
```
🖨️age🚀
```
