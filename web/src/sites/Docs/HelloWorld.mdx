# A basic "Hello, World" 👋
<br/>
To start off your journey of learning EmojiDo, we'll start with a small program that prints "Hello, World!", a traditional thing to do when learning a new programming language.
<br/>
## The setup
<br/>
*If you are using the [online executor](/#/run), you can skip this step*
<br/>
To create an EmojiDo program, create a file ending in <Code inline={true}> .ejo</Code>. This will be the main file of your program.
<br/>
## The program
<br/>
EmojiDo starts executing in the global scope, so there is no need for things like <Code inline={true}>public static void main(String[] args)</Code> and main functions in general.
<br/>
There are two ways to print to the standard output. We are going to use the legacy built-in<Code inline={true}>🖨️</Code> which should usually be avoided, but is enough for demonstration purposes.
The <Code inline={true}>🖨️</Code> is immediately followed by the string to be printed. Strings are indicated using the <Code inline={true}>🔠</Code> emoji.
In EmojiDo, all instructions are followed by a <Code inline={true}>🚀</Code>emoji, which is the equivalent to the semi-colon in some programming languages.
<br/>
With everything put together, your program should look something like this:
<br/>
<Code toCopy={"🖨️🔠Hello, World!🔠🚀"}>🖨️🔠Hello, World!🔠🚀</Code>
<br/>
Expected Output:
<br/>
<Code toCopy={"Hello, World!"}>Hello, World!</Code>
<br/>
