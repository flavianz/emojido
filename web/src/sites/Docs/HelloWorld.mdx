# A basic "Hello, World" 👋
<br/>
To start off your journey of learning EmojiDo, we'll start with a small program that prints "Hello, World!", a traditional thing to do when learning a new programming language.
<br/>
## The setup
<br/>
*If you are using the [online executor](/#/run), you can skip this step*
<br/>
To create an EmojiDo program, create a file ending in ``` .ejo ```. This will be the main file of your program.
<br/>
## The program
<br/>
EmojiDo starts executing in the global scope, so there is no need for things like ```public static void main(String[] args)``` and main functions in general.
<br/>
There are two ways to print to the standard output. We are going to use the legacy built-in ```🖨️``` which should usually be avoided, but is enough for demonstration purposes.
The ```🖨️``` is immediately followed by the string to be printed. Strings are indicated using the ```🔠``` emoji.
In EmojiDo, all instructions are followed by a ```🚀``` emoji, which is the equivalent to the semi-colon in some programming languages.
<br/>
With everything put together, your program should look something like this:
<br/>
```
🖨️🔠Hello, World!🔠🚀
```
<br/>
Expected Output:
<br/>
```
Hello, World!
```
<br/>
