# Conditionals 🎭
<br/>
Conditionals allow you to change the flow of your program based on certain conditions. In EmojiDo, this is implemented the traditional way, using <Code inline={true}>if</Code>-Statements.
<br/>
The following is a basic example:
<br/>
<Code toCopy={"📦i🪢5🚀✂️i↘️3✂️ ⚽\n   🖨️🔠Smaller🔠🚀\n🥅📐i🔗3📐⚽\n    🖨️🔠Equal🔠🚀\n🥅🗑️⚽\n    🖨️🔠Greater🔠🚀\n🥅"}>
    📦i🪢5🚀<br/>
    ✂️i↘️3✂️ ⚽<br/>
    &ensp;🖨️🔠Smaller🔠🚀<br/>
    🥅📐i🔗3📐⚽<br/>
    &ensp;🖨️🔠Equal🔠🚀<br/>
    🥅🗑️⚽<br/>
    &ensp;🖨️🔠Greater🔠🚀<br/>
    🥅
</Code>
<br/>
Let's break it down:
<br/>
The first block, indicated by the <Code inline={true}>✂️</Code> is a if-statement.
This means, that its content will only be executed if the expression provided evaluates to <Code inline={true}>✅</Code>.
<br/>
Following, indicated with <Code inline={true}>📐</Code>, is an else if-statement.
Its content is only executed if the expression provided evaluates to <Code inline={true}>✅</Code> and the expression of the if-statement before evaluated to <Code inline={true}>❌</Code>.
There can be an infinite number of else if-statements after an if-statement.
<br/>
Finally, there is an else-statement declared using <Code inline={true}>🗑️</Code>. It is executed only if all the if and else if-statements before were skipped.
