## What is EmojiDo?
<br/>
EmojiDo (also referred to as 'ğŸ™‚ğŸš€') is a statically-typed compiled programming language.
It relies solely on emojis for everything from keywords to operators to brackets.
It was created as a school project and was **never** intended to be used in a serious environment where efficiency and reliability are necessary.
<br/>
As a small example, a Hello World program looks like this:
<br/>
```
ğŸª¤ğŸ” strğŸ” ğŸš€
println ğŸ”«ğŸ” Hello, World!ğŸ” ğŸ”«ğŸš€
```
<br/>
## How can I get started?
<br/>
To run EmojiDo, you can either fork the compiler from the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/flavianz/emojido) and run the compiler locally with Node.js, or you can run your code online in the [online executor](/#/run).
<br/>
To learn all about EmojiDo and its features, start by taking a look at a [basic Hello World Program](/#/docs/hello-world/).
