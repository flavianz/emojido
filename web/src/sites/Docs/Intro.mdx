## What is EmojiDo?
<br/>
EmojiDo (also referred to as 'ğŸ™‚ğŸš€') is a compiled programming language.
It relies solely on emojis for everything from keywords to operators to brackets.
It was created as a school project and was **never** intended to be used in a serious environment where efficiency and reliability were necessary.
<br/>
As a small example, a Hello World program looks like this:
<br/>
```
ğŸª¤ğŸ” strğŸ” ğŸš€
println ğŸ”«ğŸ” Hello, World!ğŸ” ğŸ”«ğŸš€
```
