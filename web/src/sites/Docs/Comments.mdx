# Comments 📜
<br/>
There are two ways to have comments in EmojiDo.
<br/>
## Single-line comments
<br/>
Single-line comments are started using the <Code inline={true}>📣</Code> emoji and end at the end of the line.
They can be on a line by themselves or after another instruction like this:
<br/>
<Code toCopy={"📣 This is a comment.\n🖨️🔠Hello, World!🔠🚀 📣 This is also a comment!"}>
    📣 This is a comment. <br/>
    🖨️🔠Hello, World!🔠🚀 📣 This is also a comment!
</Code>
<br/>
## Multi-line comments
<br/>
Other than single-line comments, multi-line comments are started **and** ended with the <Code inline={true}>📯</Code> emoji.
This means, they can span over multiple lines, but also implemented inside of instructions like this:
<br/>
<Code toCopy={"📯 This \nis \na \ncomment! \n🖨️📯This is also a comment!📯🔠Hello, World!🔠🚀"}>
    📯 This <br/>
    is <br/>
    a <br/>
    comment!📯 <br/>
    🖨️📯This is also a comment!📯🔠Hello, World!🔠🚀<br/>
</Code>
