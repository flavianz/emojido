# Functions ðŸ›’
<br/>
Functions are a great way to modularize your code to avoid repetition and speed up your work.
<br/>
## Structure
<br/>
They are created with a <Code inline>ðŸ›’</Code> emoji, followed by the functions return type.
After this comes the identifier of the function, followed by another <Code inline>ðŸ›’</Code>. <br/>
Next up are the function arguments.
Every argument is defined by its type and identifier.
You do not have to separate the arguments with commas or similar things. You can access these arguments like any other locally scopes variable. <br/>
In the end, the scope to be executed is provided. Put together, this could look something like this:
<br/>
<Code toCopy={"ðŸ›’ðŸ”¢doSomethingðŸ›’ðŸ”¢value1ðŸ”¢value2 âš½\n     ðŸ“£ Your logic\nðŸ¥…"}>
    ðŸ›’ðŸ”¢doSomethingðŸ›’ðŸ”¢value1ðŸ”¢value2 âš½ <br/>
    &ensp; ðŸ“£ Your logic <br/>
    ðŸ¥…
</Code>
<br/>
## Returning
<br/>
You can return values from a function using the <Code inline>ðŸªƒ</Code> emoji,
followed by the expression to return.
The returned expression has to match the specified return type of the function.
Except for functions with a <Code inline>ðŸ«¥</Code> return type,
you should **always** return something from a function, although this is not enforced by the compiler.
