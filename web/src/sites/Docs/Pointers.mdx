# Pointers 🏹
<br/>
A pointer is essentially a address in the programs heap memory.
Pointers in EmojiDo do not have a type of their own, but are just simple integers.
<br/>
## Creating a pointer
<br/>
In EmojiDo, pointers can be created by simply prefixing them with a <Code inline>🏹</Code>.
A pointer can point to any data type, even another pointer.
This returns a simple integer that can be stored or changed, like in this example:
<br/>
<Code toCopy={"📦pi🪢3.14🚀\n📦address🪢🏹pi🚀"}>
    📦pi🪢3.14🚀 <br/>
    📦address🪢🏹pi🚀
</Code>
<br/>
## Dereferencing a pointer
<br/>
Dereferencing essentially means getting the value that a pointer pointed to.
This can be done by simply prefixing a pointer (so a integer) value with the <Code inline>🎯</Code> emoji.
If it is not clear what type the pointer is pointing to,
you have to specify the type of the dereferenced value in between.

    📣 Assuming the code from before is here <br/>
