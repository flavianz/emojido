# Memory Management 📂
<br/>
EmojiDo provides two functions to manage the programs memory.
To use these, import the system standard library like this:
<br/>
<Code toCopy={"🪤🔠sys🔠🚀"}>
    🪤🔠sys🔠🚀
</Code>
<br/>
## Allocating Memory
<br/>
To allocate memory, simply call the <Code inline>malloc</Code> function and the memories' size in bytes.
Please notice that the bytes will always be rounded to the next multiple of 4096.
So it does not matter if you specify <Code inline>2</Code> bytes or <Code inline>4023</Code> bytes,
both will allocate one page of memory (4096 bytes).
The function returns the address of the first byte in the allocated space as a pointer.
An example usage could look something like this:
<br/>
<Code toCopy={"🪤🔠sys🔠🚀\n📦address🪢malloc🔫10🔫🚀\n🎯🚧address + 33🧱🪢345🚀\n🖨️🎯🔢🚧address + 33🧱🚀 📣 Expected Output: '345'"}>
    🪤🔠sys🔠🚀 <br/>
    📦address🪢malloc🔫10🔫🚀 <br/>
    🎯🚧address + 33🧱🪢345🚀 <br/>
    🖨️🎯🔢🚧address + 33🧱🚀 📣 Expected Output: '345'
</Code>
<br/>
## Freeing memory
<br/>
Allocated memory has to always be freed, otherwise the program could contain memory leaks.
To free memory, call the <Code inline>free</Code>
function with the size to be freed in bytes as the first argument.
Freeing the memory allocated above would look like this:
<br/>
<Code toCopy={"free🔫10🔫🚀\n📣 Accessing 🎯address + 33 would now segfault."}>
    free🔫10🔫🚀 <br/>
    📣 Accessing 🎯address + 33 would now segfault.
</Code>
