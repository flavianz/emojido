# Emojido - express code with 🚀💥📦

🚀 - Emojido is a full programming language, just all in emojis.
⚙️ - Emojido is a compiled language that can only target x64 Linux machines for now, but there are also plans for an interpreter.
⚒️ - Emojido is a mixed level programming language, meaning you can use it with all the benefits from languages such as javascript or pyrhon. But there is also a low level memory management suite built into the language.
👷 - Emojido is still in the development phase. The core functionality works but there can be many unexpected bugs or missing features.
🤝 - I'm open for pull requests and please submit an issue if you find anything wrong with the language
